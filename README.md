# Project4

Proposal must include:

## The name of your app.
To-do List

## What your MVP looks like.

## What your reach goals are.
I just want to make fullstack rails to do app.

## User stories that describe how your app will be used.
The user is someone who is on the go and wants to have an app where they can quickly jot down things that are due. Whether that be grabbing some groceries from the store or remembering to attend a concert. 

## Wireframes!
