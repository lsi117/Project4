# Project4

### Proposal

I want to try and make a Game of Life with React. I have a ton of resources that I can use to help me create this(since i'm still trying to get the hang of react), but I think it's important for me to try and get started.

It will literally just be a simple application that will have a grid(needed for the game of life) and simple buttons to press in order to play. Nothing too over the top.

---

## Backup Plan

If I end up failing in process of making this, then I will have a backup plan of building a simple to-do app with rails.
