## What your MVP looks like.
Minimal Viable Product looks like a UX/UI friendly experience. It will be an easy interface to navigate, first off, when you open the app you will see a simple box that will house all of the todo items. The user will be able to add a todo item as well as edit, update, and delete them(resulting in full CRUD functionality). It's easy to use for a stress free experience.

## What your reach goals are.
I want to make a friendly and easy to use to do app, a fullstack rails application. Also, I would like to add the personal touch of adding some user authentication. I really like anything to do with security, it really peaks my interest and it's an area I would like to improve my skills on, so i'll push myself to do that.

## User stories that describe how your app will be used.
The user is someone who is on the go and wants to have an app where they can quickly jot down things that are due. Whether that be grabbing some groceries from the store or remembering to attend a concert.
